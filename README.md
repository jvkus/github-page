# Overview

This is the source for my portfolio website. I'm currently working on making a skeleton version for others to use. \
A slightly more basic version of this site runs on GitHub Pages, but I am currently hosting the full thing on CloudFlare, which you can visit [here](https://jvkus.dev). \
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quick Start

1. [Download and install Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
2. From your CLI, clone this repo and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm start`. The page should automatically open in your browser, but if it doesn't, visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to check it out.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the docs on [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the docs on [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run analyze`

Run after running `npm run build`. Analyzes bundle size to understand where code bloat is coming from.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

                Hi. I'm Joanna Kus.<br />
                I'm a software engineer with three years of backend and scripting 
                experience. I'm working on stepping into a more security-focused 
                role. This website is still in progress. Check back later; I 
                promise it'll be cool.
            </p>
            <Contact />
        </header>
